# FUNCTIONAL-POINT BASED-ESTIMATION
FP BASED ESTIMATION:
            Function Points are a measure used in software development to estimate the size and complexity of a software project. The estimation process involves analyzing the various functionalities and features of the software to determine its size in terms of function points. This method is often used to estimate the effort, time, and resources required for a software development project.

Here's a basic overview of how FP-based estimation works:

Categorize Functionalities: Function Points are typically categorized into different types based on their complexity and impact on the system. The common categories are:
   - External Inputs (EIs): User inputs that result in some processing and data retrieval.
   - External Outputs (EOs): Outbound information to users that involves significant processing.
   - External Inquiries (EQs): User-initiated requests for information that involves data retrieval.
   - Internal Logical Files (ILFs): Internal files that the system maintains.
   - External Interface Files (EIFs): External files that the system uses or updates.
